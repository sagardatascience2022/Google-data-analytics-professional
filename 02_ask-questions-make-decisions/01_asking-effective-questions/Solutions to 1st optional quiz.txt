Categorizing things is indeed one of the six problem types that data analysts solve. This type of problem might involve the following actions:

Data Exploration: Analyzing and understanding the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing and cleaning the data to remove errors, inconsistencies, or missing values.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.
Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning model based on the problem requirements and dataset characteristics.
Model Training: Training the selected model using the labeled data to learn patterns and make predictions.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
These actions are not exhaustive but provide a general overview of the steps involved in solving problems related to categorizing things in data analysis.

Finding patterns is one of the six problems types data analysts aim to solve . This type of problem might involve which of the following ? 1) Identifying trends from historical data 2) Noticing something outside of the ordinary 3)Analyzing how one action leads to or affects another 4)Taking categorized items and grouping them into broader topic areas
Finding patterns is indeed one of the six problem types that data analysts aim to solve. This type of problem might involve the following actions:

Identifying trends from historical data: Analyzing past data to uncover recurring patterns or behaviors.
Noticing something outside of the ordinary: Identifying anomalies or outliers that deviate from expected patterns.
Analyzing how one action leads to or affects another: Investigating cause-and-effect relationships between different variables or actions.
Taking categorized items and grouping them into broader topic areas: Organizing and classifying data into meaningful categories or clusters.
These actions are not exhaustive but provide a general overview of the steps involved in solving problems related to finding patterns in data analysis.

In the SMART methodology, questions that encourage change are described how? 1)Action-oriented 2)Specific 3)Time-bound 4)Relevant
In the SMART methodology, questions that encourage change are described as action-oriented. These questions focus on identifying specific actions or steps that can be taken to bring about the desired change. By asking action-oriented questions, individuals or teams can develop a clear plan of action and take concrete steps towards achieving their goals.

In data analytics, how are dashboards different from reports? 1)Dashboards are used to share updates with stakeholders continous access to data 2)Dashboards provide a high level look at historical data. Reports provide a more detailed look at live, interactive, data. 3)Dashboards contain static data. Reports contains data that is constantly changing 4)Dashboards monitor live, incoming data from multiple datasets and organize the information into one central location. Reports are static collections of data.

Dashboards and reports are two essential tools used in data analytics. Here are the key differences between them:

Dashboards are used to share updates with stakeholders and provide continuous access to data12. They typically display key performance indicators (KPIs) in a visual format that can be easily understood by stakeholders2. Dashboards can offer a high-level look at historical data, but they can also provide real-time insights by monitoring live, incoming data from multiple datasets23.

Reports, on the other hand, offer more detailed insights into specific aspects of the data2. They tend to be broader and feature historic data3. Reports are often structured and unchanging collections of data that are delivered periodically, providing a snapshot of a specific area or organization34.

In summary, dashboards are ideal for real-time overviews and monitoring live data, while reports offer comprehensive insights in a structured and unchanging format at repeated intervals24.

The scenario you described is an example of structured thinking. In this approach, a data analyst breaks down a vague and complex problem into smaller steps to gain a better understanding of the current problem or situation. By organizing available information, recognizing gaps and opportunities, and identifying options, they can develop a clear plan of action to address the problem effectively.
